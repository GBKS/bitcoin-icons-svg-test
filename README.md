# bitcoin-icons-svg-test

A super simple test project for the SVG module of bitcoinicons.com.

To be used in conjunction with the [release process](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Bitcoin-Icons/blob/main/RELEASES.md) to quickly launch a site that shows all the icons. This ensures things work on the tech side, and allows for visual inspection.
